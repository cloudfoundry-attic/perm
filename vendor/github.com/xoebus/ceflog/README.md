> Common Event Format Logger

## about

The ArcSight Common Event Format (CEF) can be used to emit audit logs in a
format which threat analysis and monitoring tools are able to ingest. There
doesn't seem to be a de-facto specification online for CEF but if you search
for *CEF log* you will find redistributions.

## usage

The library is modeled as a logger rather than a sink which can be plugged into
other logging libraries. This is because you only want to log audit-worthy
events rather than logging everything. This would typically be tuned by
adjusting the level (debug, info, warn, error, etc.) of a log message. This
will not work in this case because some of the audit events you want to emit
are not errors.

```go
logger := ceflog.New(w, "vendor", "product", "version")

logger.LogEvent(
    "auth.new",
    "User login",
    ceflog.Sev(0),
    ceflog.Ext("dst", "127.0.0.1"),
)
```
